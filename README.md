# Cynthia-py

## Introduction
Welcome to Cynthia-py, an innovative deep learning framework developed from scratch. My goal is to provide a user-friendly, flexible, and efficient tool for both educational and research purposes in the field of machine learning and deep learning. This repository contains many resources to help you create your very own deep learning framework!

## Features
- **Customizable Optimizers**: Implementations of various optimization algorithms like SGD, Adagrad, Momentum, and AdaDelta.
- **Efficient Tensor Operations**: Utilizes NumPy for high-performance tensor computations.
- **Automatic Gradient Computation**: Supports automatic differentiation for gradient calculations.
- **Modular and Extendable**: Designed to be easily extendable and modifiable.
- **Educational Tool**: Ideal for those looking to deepen their understanding of deep learning concepts.

## Getting Started
The framework is not yet stable for any projects as it merely contains the algorithms to start building machine/deep learning objectives.

## Contributing
Contributions are more than welcome :D If you're interested in improving Cynthia-py, please read our [Contributing Guidelines]([link-to-contributing-guidelines](https://github.com/ali-samer/Cynthia-py/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Goals for Week-3
- **Finish implementing the parameter optimizer algorithms**
- **Begin working on linear regression**
