# AdaGrad Optimization Algorithm

## Introduction
AdaGrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm) is a widely used optimization technique in machine learning, particularly for training deep neural networks. AdaGrad adapts the learning rate to the parameters, performing smaller updates for frequently occurring features and larger updates for infrequent features. This characteristic makes it suitable for dealing with sparse data and differentiating between more and less significant data points.

## Algorithm Overview
AdaGrad's main feature is its ability to modify the general learning rate to be smaller for frequently occurring features and larger for infrequent ones. This is particularly useful for datasets with large variances in feature frequency. AdaGrad can lead to improved convergence over standard gradient descent, especially in scenarios with sparse data and irregular feature distribution.

### Key Features:
- Adaptive learning rates for each parameter
- Good performance on problems with sparse data
- Reduces the learning rate for each parameter proportionally to the sum of its historical squared gradients
