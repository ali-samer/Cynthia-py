# Momentum Optimization Algorithm

## Introduction
The Momentum algorithm is a popular optimization technique in the field of machine learning and deep learning. It is designed to accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading to faster converging. It is one of the enhancements to the standard gradient descent optimization method.

## Algorithm Overview
Momentum optimization is inspired by the physical concept of momentum in which an object in motion tends to stay in motion. In the context of optimization, it helps to push the algorithm across valleys and over smaller hills, potentially leading to faster convergence compared to standard gradient descent.

### Key Features:
- Accelerates convergence in relevant directions
- Helps to overcome local minima problems
- Often leads to faster training than standard gradient descent
